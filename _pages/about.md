I am a PhD student in Paleoclimatology at CEREGE (France), specializing in Cenozoic ocean dynamics. My research focuses on the evolution of ocean circulation and its impact on biogeochemical cycles. Using Earth System Models, I investigate how major paleogeographic and climatic shifts have reshaped the marine environment throughout the Cenozoic era.
