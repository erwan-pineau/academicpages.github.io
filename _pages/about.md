I am a PhD student in paleoclimatology at CEREGE (France). I am interested in past climates, particularly the evolution of the ocean circulation during the Cenozoic. I use the Earth system models to better understand how the paleogeographic and climatic changes have impacted the ocean circulation and the biogeochemical cycles.
